# The End

Congratulations! 🏆

You've reached the end of the TypeScript for React Developers minishop, learning how to define type-safe props, type-check hooks, type-check event handlers, and so much more!

Hopefully, you'll get to apply this learning right away at your job or in a side project. But if not, I suggest you **come back to this minishop in a week or two** and review the content. Your brain likes to garbage collect unused knowledge and we want this to stick around! The content is all open-source.

## ❤️ Minishop Feedback

Feedback is a gift. 🎁 Now that you're done with the minishop, I would greatly appreciate your overall feedback on the minishop to help make it even better for the next learners. **[Share your minishop feedback](https://bit.ly/ts-react-ms-feedback)**.
