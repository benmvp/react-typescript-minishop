# Step 0 - Begin Minishop

🏅 The goal of this step is to ensure you have your development environment properly set up.

## 📝 Tasks

Complete the [setup instructions](../../README.md#setup)! It's your **last chance**! 🏃🏾‍♂️💨

If you ran the setup **before today**, pull any changes to the repo and re-run the setup to ensure that you have the most up-to-date code examples:

```sh
git pull --rebase=false
npm run setup
```

This should run pretty quickly.

Finally, run the app if you haven't already!

```sh
npm start
```

Let's get started! 🎉
