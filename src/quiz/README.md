# Final Quiz!

Throughout the steps we've been building various parts of a [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) search app as we've learned how to apply TypeScript to React apps.

🏅 The goal of this final step, the quiz, is to put all the pieces together to create a fully-functioning Giphy search app.

  <summary><b>Help! I didn't finish the previous step! 🚨</b></summary>

If you didn't successfully complete the previous step, that's okay! The steps are meant to push you. 😄

However, you may find yourself in a position where you app is not compiling because of TypeScript errors, and it's preventing you from working on the quiz. No problem! Stash your changes **in a new terminal window**, and you should be good to continue:

```sh
git stash push -m "In-progress Step 4 exercises"
```

Your app should automatically reset and you should be able to continue on with the quiz.

## 💡 Exercises

The Giphy search app should allow for filtering by name and rating, as well as choose the number of results to show from a drop down.

Some guidance:

- Use the results display UI from [Step 1](../01-props)
- Use the search form from [Step 3](../03-events), including the bonus to add the ratings filter
- Use the API and custom hook from [Step 4](../04-api)

Share your working app with me on my [AMA](http://www.benmvp.com/ama/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benmvp)!
