# Final Quiz!

Throughout the steps we've been building various parts of a [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) search app as we've learned how to apply TypeScript to React apps.

üèÖ The goal of this final step, the quiz, is to put all the pieces together to create a fully-functioning Giphy search app.

## üí° Exercises

The Giphy search app should allow for filtering by name and rating, as well as choose the number of results to show from a drop down.

Some guidance:

- Use the results display UI from [Step 1](../01-props)
- Use the search form from [Step 3](../03-events), including the bonus to add the ratings filter
- Use the API and custom hook from [Step 4](../04-api)

Share your working app with me on my [AMA](http://www.benmvp.com/ama/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benmvp)!
